## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

first time working with media queries and responsive design in this way

```css
@media (min-width: 780px) {
    body
    {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
    }
    #txt
    {
        max-width: 500px;
        margin: auto;
    }
    table
    {
        margin:auto;
        max-width: 400px;
    }
}
```


### Continued development

Become more comfortable with flexbox and responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) - helped a lot with understanding how box models work, other tabs from the same website helped a lot with understanding how responsive design works.
